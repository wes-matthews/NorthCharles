<h1>Addictions Treatment Programs</h1>
<br>
<p>Our Addiction treatment programs are based on the premise that drug and alcohol abuse, while presented as the primary problem, is only one segment of a wide range of personal and social issues that interfere with a person’s ability to live a safe and satisfying lifestyle. It is recognized that while there may be some healthy and satisfying aspects to an addicted person’s life, to define drug use as the only problem is too narrow a view of human living.  Therefore, we believe that substance use disorders have biologic, psychodynamic, socio-cultural, and behavioral components that must be addressed over the long-term.  Our program is designed to meet a client’s individual needs, with the ultimate goal of assisting the client in attaining and maintaining a drug and alcohol free lifestyle.
    We utilize a team approach to address the physical, psychological and social aspects of treatment.  Our clinical treatment team consists of a Medical Director, Psychiatrist, Registered Nurses, Licensed Practicing Nurses, Licensed Social Workers, Licensed Mental Health Counselors, and Masters Level Clinicians.  In addition, we are a well known teaching facility affiliated with the Cambridge Hospital, Department of Psychiatry and Harvard Medical School and therefore may have psychiatric residents, fellows and interns to add to our team.
    Staff members are available on site for assistance and support.  Counseling, nursing, supervisory and administrative staff are available to assist clients during clinic hours and throughout the day.  The program offers both day and evening hours to accommodate schedules and preferences of the persons served.</p>

            <p><h2>IMPACT Substance Abuse Treatment</h2>is a Department of Public Health licensed outpatient substance abuse treatment program offering recovery based, goal oriented outpatient alcohol and drug treatment to individuals, age sixteen and older, and whose lives are negatively impacted by substance use.   The program’s goal is to assist clients and families in attaining and maintaining substance free lives.  Our objective is to provide an individually designed comprehensive therapy program to identify and meet the client’s individual needs.  Clients eligible for IMPACT services are those who do not need a more intensive level of care due to medical, psychological or behavioral problems. (e.g. drug and alcohol tapering needs, methadone maintenance treatment, residential services).  Referrals are offered to clients deemed ineligible for IMPACT.  Services include individual, group and family counseling, case management, and psychopharmacology services at our 54 Wasghburn Ave., Cambridge location.  </p>
